## Welcome!

I am Daniel Palomar, a Professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). I work on optimization problems related to financial systems and data analytics in general. My webpage is https://www.danielppalomar.com

Here you'll find repositories that host practical implementations of the research published by the [Convex Group](https://www.danielppalomar.com/group/).
Video presentations are available on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/danielpalomar.
